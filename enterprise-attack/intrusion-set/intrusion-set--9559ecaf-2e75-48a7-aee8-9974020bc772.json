It is believed that the actors behind MONSOON are the same actors behind Operation Hangover. While attribution is unclear, the campaign has targeted victims with military and political interests in the Indian Subcontinent. (Citation: Forcepoint Monsoon) Operation Hangover has been reported as being Indian in origin, and can be traced back to 2010. (Citation: Operation Hangover May 2013)",
