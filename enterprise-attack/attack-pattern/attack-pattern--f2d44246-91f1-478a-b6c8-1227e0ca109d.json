This may be done to evade some defenses, such as static indicator scanning tools and anti-virus. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA)\n\nThe NTFS format has a feature called Extended Attributes (EA), which allows data to be stored as an attribute of a file or folder. (Citation: Microsoft File Streams)\n\nDetection: Forensic techniques exist to identify information stored in EA. (Citation: Journey into IR ZeroAccess NTFS EA) It may be possible to monitor NTFS for writes or reads to NTFS EA or to regularly scan for the presence of modified information.\n\nPlatforms: Windows\n\nData Sources: File monitoring, Kernel drivers\n\nDefense Bypassed: Signature-based detection, Anti-virus, Host forensic analysis\n\nSystem Requirements: NTFS partitioned hard drive",
