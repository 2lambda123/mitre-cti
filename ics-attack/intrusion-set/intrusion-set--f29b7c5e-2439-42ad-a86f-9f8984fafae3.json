            "description": "[HEXANE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1001) is a threat group that has targeted ICS organization within the oil & gas, and telecommunications sectors. Many of the targeted organizations have been located in the Middle East including Kuwait. [HEXANE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1001)'s targeting of telecommunications has been speculated to be part of an effort to establish man-in-the-middle capabilities throughout the region. [HEXANE](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1001)'s TTPs appear similar to [APT33](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0003) and [OilRig](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0010) but due to differences in victims and tools it is tracked as a separate entity.
